// Per-frame decompression status.
//
// The GPU frame parser writes one entry per input frame into the caller-supplied
// status buffer. Each entry is formatted as an HRESULT:
//   * kzstdgpu_FrameStatus_Success (S_OK, 0) when the frame header is well-formed
//     and the frame was accepted for decompression.
//   * a failure HRESULT otherwise. Failure codes set the Severity (0x8...) and
//     Customer (0x2...) bits and use a zstdgpu-specific facility (0x7A) so they
//     never collide with system-defined HRESULTs. Test them with the usual
//     FAILED()/SUCCEEDED() semantics; the low 16 bits carry the reason code.
//
// NB: these constants are shared verbatim between the C++ library and the HLSL
//     shaders, so the values written on the GPU match what the caller reads back.

// counters, and cannot be attributed to an individual frame -- so every frame in
// the batch that had not already failed for its own reason is marked, because no
// frame's output can be trusted once predicated work has been skipped.
//
// Without these, exceeding the scratch bound skips the predicated work SILENTLY
// and the decode returns wrong output with a success status. That is the exact
// failure mode the per-frame status buffer exists to make impossible.
